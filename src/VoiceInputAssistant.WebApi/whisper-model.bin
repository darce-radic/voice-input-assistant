# Placeholder Whisper Model File
# 
# In a production environment, this would be replaced with an actual Whisper model file
# from OpenAI Whisper. The model files are typically downloaded from:
# https://github.com/openai/whisper/
#
# Common models:
# - tiny.en (39 MB)
# - base.en (74 MB) 
# - small.en (244 MB)
# - medium.en (769 MB)
# - large-v2 (1550 MB)
#
# To use an actual model:
# 1. Download the desired model from the Whisper repository
# 2. Replace this placeholder file with the actual .bin file
# 3. Update the ModelPath in appsettings.json if needed
#
# For development/testing purposes, the application should handle
# missing models gracefully and potentially fall back to a mock service.
